# jsf2-jboss-hibernate
This is a pretty big project I developed a few years back when I was experimenting with different Java MVC frameworks.
This web app (PortalPlan) is a weekly scheduler that can:

- Connect to LinkedIn api and retrieve connections of a user which can later be added to weekly tasks
- Very comprehensive UI using PrimeFaces with different filters and task categories
- RSS news page, Weather forecasts and live stock price updates 
- All schedules can be transformed into custom designed PDF files
- User authentication and security
- All user input is saved into a relational database.

Used:
- JBoss,
- JSF 2.0
- PrimeFaces
- Hibernate
